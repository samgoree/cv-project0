# CSC 399 -- Image Processing and Computer Vision 
## Project 0

In this project, we are going to practice our basics and repair a series of poorly-edited images. In this repo, you will find seven edited images. For each one, there is a simple way to undo the edit and restore the image to its original (nice-looking) state. Your task is to figure out how. 

Check your final images versus the original sources below. If you can get 5/7 of the images, you get full points, and no extra credit will be awarded for getting all 7 (but you can brag you solved a tricky puzzle!)

Please use OpenCV in C++ unless we have discussed otherwise. A minimal OpenCV c++ file, header file and CMakeLists.txt is provided. Please compile your code with cmake to guarantee compatability with my grading setup.
